stuff to do for the website:

create landing page to collect user info (mating)

create logic to count number of available crew.

add more races (easy)

create logic to create trips (hard, think of a solution)
	- you could let the skipper do it
	- you could do it and get people to join, then let the skipper see the crew available.

create the email function to send people notification emails

cron job to delete old races
