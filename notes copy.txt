stuff to do for the website:

create landing page to collect user info (mkting)
	-remember to download eliot’s video
	-get a video editing suite that doesn’t cost an arm and a leg (and download it)


create logic to count number of available crew.
	- this could be done by having a “max crew” attribute in the Trip class with some logic being like Trip.max_attendees - CrewMember.count cannot = 0


create logic to create trips (hard, think of a solution)
	- you could let the skipper do it
	- you could do it and get people to join, then let the skipper see the crew available.
	- you could also have a button for people who are not sure. select available for all available trips on that day.
	- how to connect accounts with skippers?
	- perhaps get their boat name and connect it with the trip name.


implement error pages, think of possible places where errors could pop up.

Think about how skippers/boatowners interact with crew.

Crew are likely to sign up. It costs them nothing. 

create the email function to send people notification emails

cron job to delete old races
	- created first part (rake task)
	- now to create cron job (but I can wait to do this until I put it on a permanent server)
